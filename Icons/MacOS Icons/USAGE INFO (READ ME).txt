About This Icon Pack:

Here are a heap of Apple's native TouchBar icons sorted and named for putting into your TouchBar Icons!

ðŸ”µ Blue Tag = NEW    (Recently added in this version)

__________________________________

USAGE TIP: 
Check on [Keep aspect ratio when resizing buttons] within BTT's [General Touch Bar Settings] and consider the following:


- Height Rule: -
When importing into BTT TouchBar buttons, Always set the icon height to 30px. This will render them sharper and as Apple intended.

BTT's default 22px does not match the system's default 30px height which these icons are designed for.

Exclusions to this height rule:
â€¢ Photoshop Icons


__________________________________

Do not use or sell these for any other reason other than creating your own BTT presets or else you might get into trouble!
